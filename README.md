# Feature-Selection-and-ANN-predictive-modelling
# Introduction
Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different
kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into 
cancer. This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the 
SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The 
dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer 
(SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010.Patients with 
unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival
months wereless than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.
## Aim and Objective 
The aim of this project was centred on the Importance of Feature engineering with feature selection
as the main point and also steered away from regular machine learning algorithm and utilised the
artificial neural network for prediction. As data structures are being studied we know that the more
we compute many columns for modelling, we tend to use up more time and space as well as computing
components so feature selection helps to check which columns play a vital role in the relationship
between the independent and the target variable. In doing so, the redundancy in the data will be 
reduced and also saving alot of time and space. We know how important the neural network is in terms 
of complex production but it can also be very powerful in terms of predictive modelling in that with
little statistical training,  and the ability to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships 
between dependent and independent variables and the  ability to detect all possible interactions between
predictor variables, the connections sparce very greatly so with in which it is easier to train a complex
data on neural network than the conventional algorithms of machine learning.
# Summary
After the training was done, we found the model having an accuracy of 90% and the after performing two
statistical feature selection methods, the best predictor variables were selected efficiently. This 
would help in the world as data collected by companies are so numerous and sometimes it would pose
a problem determining which variable is important to determine a certain factor for the growth of the
firm. That is one of the many important roles feature selection plays.
